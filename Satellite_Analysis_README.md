# Satellite Analysis - README

## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of satellite data to evaluate various parameters and gain insights from satellite metrics. The objective is to analyze satellite data, identify key trends, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement. The analysis utilizes data from multiple sources and provides visualizations for easier interpretation.

## Key Files
1. **data.xlsx**: Contains raw satellite data including various metrics collected over time.
2. **Satellites analysis.twb**: Tableau workbook for interactive data visualization and exploration.

## Key Sections of the Analysis
1. **Data Overview**: Summary of satellite data, including key metrics and data collection parameters.
2. **Visual Analysis**: Tableau dashboard provides a visual interpretation of satellite data, focusing on trends, anomalies, and key performance indicators.
3. **Parameter Analysis**: Analysis of various parameters measured by satellites, such as signal strength, orbit stability, and data accuracy.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying anomalies in satellite metrics to understand potential issues or areas for improvement.

## Recommendations
1. **Parameter Optimization**: Adjusting satellite parameters to enhance data accuracy and signal strength.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Regularly reviewing trends to detect early signs of performance degradation.
3. **Anomaly Monitoring**: Implementing a system for real-time anomaly detection to promptly address issues.
